1)	Demo current data manipulation activities using SQL.
•	Copy pasting of values from the legacy extract to the templates.
•	Delete all the other rows that are not Saved / Submitted.
•	Change the data to format "YYY-MM-DD"
•	Change the date time field to format "YYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"
•	Legacy extract has _vod in account names like Person_accout_vod, We use find and replace to remove the _vod
•	Removing of values from selective cells (HCO Id's for Group Account)
•	Concatenating of 2 names from different columns in the format "Anand, Prashanthi" and using the same to lookup Filtering for 1's and 0's in a column

2)	Mappings:
•	When there is value Submitted - We use the if function to mark it as true and others as false.
•	There are values under account types and specialties, where we map to accepted set of values. Eg: Others is unaccepted. We add another column, filter for only "others", add the accepted value Other in the new column.
•	Copy paste of columns from one csv to another
•	VLOOKUP performed to extract External IDs
•	Find and Replace Yes / No values to True and False

3)	Other Questions?
•	How do we rename columns?
•	How do we export the file and upload to OneDrive?
•	In case of foreign characters will SQL handle it ?



Project explanation

Novartis is in different countries, globally novartis wants to take all this and put this into one system. Transferring the data from legacy systems 
transfer them into new ways and give them to the data migration to push them into salesforce. 

Loads:-
-> test load(1st template)
-> qa load(checking if the standards are assured)
-> production load(rework everything again)
